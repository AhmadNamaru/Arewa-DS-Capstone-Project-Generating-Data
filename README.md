# Project Description

This project demonstrates the visualization of cubic numbers using Python. We start by plotting the first five cubic numbers and then extend the plot to the first 5,000 cubic numbers. Additionally, we apply a colormap to these plots to enhance the visual representation. The project utilizes the `matplotlib` library for plotting and includes both line plots and scatter plots with colormaps.

## What to Expect

1. **Plot of the First Five Cubic Numbers**: A simple line plot showing the cubic values of the numbers 1 through 5.
2. **Plot of the First 5,000 Cubic Numbers**: A more extensive line plot displaying the cubic values of the numbers 1 through 5,000.
3. **Colormap Applied to Cubic Numbers**: Scatter plots of the first five and first 5,000 cubic numbers with a colormap applied to visually differentiate the values.
